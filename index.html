        <h3>Web Design & Web development</h3>
        <p>I have firstly come across web development in the 9th grade as it was part of the curriculum for the Information Technology class and I had
          to admit I had felt an attraction towards it since the first day.</p>
        <p>One particular aspect which got my attention and actually made me choose this topic was the impression I had on the growth of internet. I
          wanted to know more about it, how the whole World Wide Web concept started and go to the process of creating advanced websites and web-based
          applications myself.</p>

          lifestyle.</p>
